# GroceryListApp
This is a Grocery List App I created to help my family coordinate our grocery list between android devices. It uses a Firestore database to synchronize the list in real time between devices. 

# Security Policy
For security, this repo does not contain the google-services.json file necessary to connect to a firebase firestore application.
If you wish to use this app, you will need to build it with an appropriate google-services.json file taken from firebase.
The firestore database needs to contain an empty collection named "groceries".
