# GroceryListApp

For security, this repo does not contain the google-services.json file necessary to connect to a firebase firestore application.
If you wish to use this app, you will need to build it with an appropriate google-services.json file taken from firebase.
The firestore database needs to contain an empty collection named "groceries".
